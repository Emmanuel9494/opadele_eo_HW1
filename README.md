# OPADELE_EO_HW1
*This repo is for MMED-1054 Home work #1 assignment and there will be a collaborator on this repo. 
and i will create a HTML file name (RepoCollab) which will be an index page/home page to actually build out a one page site for my collab and I.
The RepoCollab html file is a way for my collab and I to keep coming back and making changes, strenghten our github use practice and getting more comfortable with wworking in the enviroment; as we keep learning more about html and eventually css to style our html.*
